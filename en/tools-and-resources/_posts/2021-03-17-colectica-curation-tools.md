From the [Colectica Curation Tools](https://github.com/Colectica/curation/tree/v0.9) README: The Colectica Curation Tools allow data archives to structure the curation workflow. The platform combines several open source and off-the-shelf components with a new, web-based data pipeline application. The software builds on the DDI standard to enable a seamless framework for collecting, processing, archiving, and publishing data. The platform enables open access to data resources that have been fully reviewed and enhanced for long term usability and analysis.

[This 2020 publication](http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-028) by Limor Peer and Joshua Dull describes the tools used in practice.

The [CSIRO 5-star Data Rating Tool](https://doi.org/10.4225/08/5a12348f8567b) is a self-assessment rating scheme that dataset creators or curators can use to evaluate FAIRness. CSIRO has also published details of the [criteria used](https://confluence.csiro.au/display/OZNOME/Data+ratings) to create their 5-star data rating scheme.

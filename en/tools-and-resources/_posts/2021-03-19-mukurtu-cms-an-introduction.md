[Mukurtu](http://mukurtu.org/) (MOOK-oo-too) is a grassroots project aiming to empower communities to manage, share, narrate, and exchange their digital heritage in culturally relevant and ethically-minded ways. Mukurtu CMS has been developed as an access platform and is intended to serve as one component in your larger digital stewardship ecosystem (access, preservation, sustainability).

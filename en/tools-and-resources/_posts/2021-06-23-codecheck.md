Description from the [CODECHECK website](https://codecheck.org.uk/): CODECHECK tackles one of the main challenges of computational research by supporting codecheckers with a workflow, guidelines and tools to evaluate computer programs underlying scientific papers. The independent time-stamped runs conducted by codecheckers will award a "certificate of executable computation" and increase availability, discovery and reproducibility of crucial artefacts for computational sciences. 

The [CODECHECK community process guide](https://codecheck.org.uk/guide/community-process) describes the necessary requirements to begin checking code as well as the specific tasks and steps performed by codecheckers.

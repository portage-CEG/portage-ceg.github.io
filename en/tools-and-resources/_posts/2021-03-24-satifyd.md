[SATIFYD](https://satifyd.dans.knaw.nl/) is the Self-Assessment Tool to Improve the FAIRness of Your Dataset from the Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS). It can be used by data creators or curators to evaluate how FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) a dataset is, and the tool provides tips for improving your FAIRness score.

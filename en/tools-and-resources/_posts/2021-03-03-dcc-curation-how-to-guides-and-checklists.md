Data Curation Centre (DCC) [guides and checklists](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides) for data management and curation support staff. The How-to Guides provide working-level knowledge of curation topics. Each provides background concepts and practical steps aiming to help people in research or support roles implement data management capabilities in their organisation, or better align them with best practices. Checklists also provide working-level knowledge, but cover less of the relevant background. Each aims to ensure practitioners have addressed the full scope of a challenging curation topic, and provides further sources of guidance.

## FAQs

**Q: I need to do a light level of curation on new submissions to our institutional repository. How should I begin?**  
* See the [Quickstart Guide](getting-started) section of this website for basic information about data curation, and resources to help you get started.

**Q: Can I redistribute content with an Open Government License (OGL)?**
* Information and resources with an Open Government License (OGL) may be copied, modified, adapted, translated, published and redistributed. The information provider should be acknowledged, and if possible a link to the license should be provided. For further information, see [Open Government Licence - Canada](https://open.canada.ca/en/open-government-licence-canada).

**Q: Are the Creative Commons licenses appropriate for software?**
* The Creative Commons (CC) organization [addresses this in their FAQ](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-apply-a-creative-commons-license-to-software) and recommends against using a CC license for software. CC licenses do not specifically address distribution of source code, or patent rights, and CC licenses are not generally compatible with many existing software licenses. 
* The [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org) maintains a [list of open source licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses) that are appropriate for software, which have undergone their ‘License Review Process’.

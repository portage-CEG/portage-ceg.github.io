The Library of Congress' [Recommended Formats Statement](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rfs/TOC.html) presents the formats which it has decided to recommend, both internally to its own professionals and externally to creators, vendors and archivists, as the preferred ones to use to ensure the preservation and long-term access of the creative output of the nation and the world.
